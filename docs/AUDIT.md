# Full Site Audit â€” September 2025

## Executive Summary
Small targeted fixes were applied to harden contact UX and to guard SEO metadata. Core systems (queues, logging, health scripts) are operating, and tests cover host/guard rules for the admin area.

## Findings
| Severity | Area | Evidence | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| High | Admin host separation | tests/Feature/Admin/HostRedirectTest.php | Keep redirect enforcing `admin.swaeduae.ae` host (#52) |
| Medium | Contact form UX | app/Http/Controllers/ContactController.php / resources/views/public/contact.blade.php | Redirect to `/contact#thanks`, scroll to success banner, and clear fields (#53) |
| Medium | SEO metadata regressions | tests/Feature/SeoMetaTest.php | Regression tests ensure canonical and Open Graph tags on `/` and `/about` (#54) |
| Low | Microcache toggle unused | tools reports indicate `X-MicroCache: SKIP` | Evaluate enabling microcache for high-traffic pages |

## Notes
- CSRF, honeypot `__website`, and throttle (5/min) remain active on contact form.
- Security headers include Referrer-Policy, X-Frame-Options, and CSP allowing `plausible.io`.
- Larger refactors (e.g., N+1 query audits, ARIA sweep) should be tracked separately.
