Project: SwaedUAE (Laravel 11 + Sanctum). Tailwind is compiled (NO CDN).
Rules:
- Only edit VIEWS & ASSETS unless I say otherwise.
- Return a UNIFIED DIFF only (no prose).
- Minimal changes, keep existing structure.
- Use our Tailwind tokens; every new public view must extend 'public.layout'.
- After the diff, list any commands to run (build css, artisan clears).
